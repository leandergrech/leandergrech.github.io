# The Whys, Hows and Whens

We decided to go to Australia on a December night, drinking beer and exclaiming how lucky a friend of ours was for getting the funding for IPAC in Melbourne. It was then that we realised that what was holding us back was our lack of imagination, because why not go to Australia on an hour's notice!

A couple of months and a LOT of plane tickets, tour reservations and car rentals later, May 2019 arrived, and we set off to the other side of the planet. It sounds weird saying it like that, because to us it felt like the most boring and inefficient mode of *teleportation* man has ever invented. Here is how it works; you go inside a pressurised cabin for three quarters of a day; you fight the urge to open the cabin doors midflight and take everyone to see their maker when the person in front of you decides to take a nap and (in)advertently halving your leg space; and then lo and behold, you are in Adelaide!

In Adelaide we took another couple of hours flight to Cairns and that's where the fun began! We landed at night, and the hot humid air felt like a gentle caress after spending more than a day in the dry, artificial air of planes and airports. In fact, I did not expect I would ever be grateful for humidity as that day, because as a person hailing from an island myself I know a thing or two about the horrors that humidity can bring upon you.

# Cairns and Port Douglas
So we landed in Cairns on a Sunday night and then it was only Ms. L and I as our friend Mr. E was inbound on another flight due the next afternoon. Anyways, L and I called and Uber and went to find our hostel. It was called Traveller's Oasis. That night we went for a stroll in Cairns, taking in the town, and a burger from McDonalds. I know what the experienced traveller might say: "Take in local food!", and yeah I know and we knew, it was just late and we played it *safe*, so chill. However, the next morning I did try *local* food, if you can call Hollandaise sauce food, and I nearly threw up. From then it seemed that local and small restaurant standards were not exactly in synch with ours, and that's ok! Who else will consume the other half of the world's production in mayonnaise? Anyway on that Monday we went to visit Cairns properly and there we got the first glimpse of the Pacific! We were already in our swimsuits and ready to go to the beach, however as naive and possibly jet-lagged as we were we failed to notice the *saltwater crocodile* warning sign. Fortunately we were restrained by mayonnaise in our stomachs so we didn't jump right in. Suspicions also started to rise when we saw a perfectly nice beach devoid of people. Then a slight Eureka moment followed by stress as we saw the sign.
